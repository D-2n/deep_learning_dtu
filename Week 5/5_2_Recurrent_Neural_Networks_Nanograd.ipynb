    "In this lab, we will introduce different ways of learning from sequential data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a recurring example, we will train neural networks to do language modelling, i.e. predict the next token in a sentence. In the context of natural language processing a token could be a character or a word, but mind you that the concepts introduced here apply to all kinds of sequential data, such as e.g. protein sequences, weather measurements, audio signals, or videos, just to name a few.\n",

    "To really get a grasp of what is going on inside a recurrent neural network (RNN), we will carry out a substantial part of this exercise in Nanograd rather than PyTorch. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start off with a simple toy problem, build an RNN using Nanograd, train it, and see for ourselves that it really works. Once we're convinced, you will implement the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell, also in Nanograd. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is *not* simple but with the DenseLayer class we already have, it is doable. Having done it yourself will help you understand what happens under the hood of the PyTorch code we will use throughout the course.\n",

    "In previous labs we mainly considered data $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d$ is the feature space dimension.\n",
    "With time sequences our data can be represented as $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, d}$, where $t$ is the sequence length. \n",
    "This emphasises sequence dependence and that the samples along the sequence are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).\n",
    "\n",
    "With RNNs, we can model both many-to-one functions: $\\mathbb{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^c$ and many-to-many functions: $\\mathbb{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, c}$, where $c$ is the amount of classes/output dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to represent sequences. With text, the challenge is how to represent a word as a feature vector in $d$ dimensions, as we are required to represent text with decimal numbers in order to apply neural networks to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will use a simple one-hot encoding but for categorical variables that can take on many values (e.g. words in the English language) this may be infeasible. For such scenarios, you can project the encodings into a smaller space by use of embeddings. If you want to learn more about tokens, encodings and embeddings than what is covered in this exercise, we highly recommend [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEMJRjEdNzM&list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z)."

A sequence is first fed into the forward LSTM cell and the reversed sequence is then used as input to the backward LSTM cell together with the last hidden state from the forward LSTM cell. Follow [this link](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4b80/89bc9b49f84de43acc2eb8900035f7d492b2.pdf) for the original paper from 1997(!).\n",

Next week we will also explore ways to combine RNNs with other types of layers for even more expressive function approximators."
